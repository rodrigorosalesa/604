    "### Introduction\n",
    "The domain of our project covers both economic and healthcare-related indicators of the wellbeing of G20 countries during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, we will be examining data related to the prevalence and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the governmental and societal measures taken to reduce the spread of the disease, and the performance of key stock market indices during the pandemic. These data were all daily reported between January 2020 and October 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting and important topic of study because, in our increasingly interconnected world, contagious diseases can be transmitted over vast distances remarkably easily. Even small, remote outbreaks of diseases anywhere in the world can swiftly turn into a global pandemic, which can then cause devastation on personal, societal, and worldwide scales. "

    "### Guiding Questions\n",
    "1. How did COVID-19 impact the performance of the financial markets in G20 countries? \n",
    "    - What is the relationship between the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 (i.e., new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths) in a country and the performance of that country’s strongest stock exchange index?\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "2. Did government and societal healthcare actions influence the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in G20 countries? \n",
    "    - Is there a correlation between vaccination, booster-shot, and policy response rates and the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in the G20 countries?\n",
    "<br> <br>  \n",
    "3. Is the relationship, if any, between financial market performance and the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 moderated by the healthcare measures taken by a G20 county?"

    "### Individual Datasets\n",
    "The first dataset we will use consists of diverse information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a country’s daily rates of COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, deaths, vaccinations, and booster shots. We will use features of these data to determine the prevalence and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the G20 countries on each day between January 1, 2020 and October 26, 2022. We chose to examine the G20 countries for this project because we believe this subset of countries will have reliably reported data. In addition, by focusing our investigative scope, we will be able to more deeply explore the data.
